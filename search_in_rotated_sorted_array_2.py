# There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).
# Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) 
# such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). 
# For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].
# Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, 
# or false if it is not in nums.
# You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
